Which led me to think to myself: like Jeopardy! Of course following that train of thought led me to find the funniest answers out of context, while these may be different from the previous responses I've given, I am absolutely positive that they are each individually the funniest and most beautiful numbers in existence. You do not get to decide which number is the funniest in each moment, however you do have the power to channel the comedy of mathematics through you in every second. The cosmic random number generator that courses through each of our beings determines what number will be funniest, and changes its mind frequently. I think the funniest number is neither eternal nor fleeting, it simply is, was, will be again, and never has been. That is the best answer I can give, and I thank you for your careful consideration"
